## Week 1

### Concept

![concept week 1](https://github.com/Daan-Zwarthoed/functional-programming/blob/main/images/week1-concept.jpg)

My concept for week 1 is making a data cleaner. For this I made a small form in which you can put your data in a textarea and then enter which cleanings you do or don't want. When you submit the form you get the cleaned data and a table in which you can change the keys of all the questions. Also you can look at the answers and how many times they were answered.

### Installation

## Week 2

### Concept

My concept for week 2 is the fetching of data from an API. I chose the Last.fm API. THat is a music API with information about the most famous artists and tracks in the world. I have collected the most famous artists and tracks voor a country of choice (Right now the Netherlands). And the most famous artists and tracks of the world.
